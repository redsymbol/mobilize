class Domains:
    '''
    Represents the various domains involved in mobilization

    This encapsulates reasoning on the different domain names involved
    in the client's web presence - desktop, mobile and everything in
    between.

    In general, there will be four canonical domains for a client's site:
      - the HTTP desktop (www.example.com)
      - the HTTPS desktop (secure.example.com)
      - the HTTP mobile (m.example.com)
      - the HTTPS mobile (m.secure.example.com)

    In many cases, the HTTPS and HTTP domains will be the same, so
    there are only two (www.example.com and m.example.com).  And of
    course for non-ecommerce sites, only the HTTP domains are needed,
    so again two.  At the other extreme, there may more (e.g. if there
    are desktop, tablet and mobile versions).

    For now, let's assume there are four domains to balance.

    Within these four, we have to make additional distinctions.  The
    best use case is in dealing with 301 and 302 redirects that send
    the Location: header during development.  In development, you'll
    need to use alternate domains (such as example.mwuclient.com:2280
    and example.mwuclient.com:2443 for the regular and secure mobile
    sites, respectively).  And if you hit a 301 that sends a
    "Location: http://example.com/foo/bar" header, you want Mobilize
    to recognize that and replace it with "Location:
    http://example.mwuclient.com:2280/foo/bar" - but only during
    development.

    The Domains instance manages the info needed to make all this
    happen.  Different parts of Mobilize use it whenever they need to
    calculate based on what the different domains are.

    The only values you need to supply to the constructor are mobile
    and desktop.  For simple regular and ecommerce websites, the
    Domains ctor will be able to correctly guess at the other values.

    In practice when configuring real mobilize sites, you'll want to
    often use the from_defs class method.

    The Domains object will have str-valued attributes representing
    all the distinctions Mobilize may need.  These are exactly the
    same as the arguments to the constructor (not repeating here so
    the two lists won't get out of sync).  You can always access any
    of these properties; in simple cases they will just have the same
    value as either the mobile or desktop domain.

        Note there is no argument for https_desktop right now.  We can

class HandlerMap:
    '''
    Represents a mapping between pages (URLs) and their handlers
    '''
    def __init__(self, mapping):
        '''
        ctor

        The mapping object is a list of tuples, each representing a
        possible moplate match.  The order matters; moplates will
        match the first URL in the list.

        Each element of the mapping list is a (key, value) 2-tuple.
        The keys can be either raw strings, or Python regular
        expression objects.  If the former, the key will be internally
        converted to a Python regex object, after prepending with
        start-of-line match (i.e. the "^" character).

        HANDLER AND MOPLATE RESOLUTION
        
        The values of the mapping object specify handlers, which are
        often moplates. Each value can be either:
          1) a Handler instance
          2) a string
          3) a tuple of two strings

        The last two are shortcuts for specifying particular moplates.
        If a single string, this is assumed to be a module that has a
        'moplate' attribute, of type Moplate.  That object is imported
        as the handler.

        If a tuple of two strings, this is assumed to be a module
        (first string) that has a attribute (second string) that is
        the moplate to import.

        The mechanics of these moplate resolution shortcuts are
        handled with the find_moplate and import_moplate functions in
        this module.
