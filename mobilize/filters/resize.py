    Resize something embedded in an object tag to have a mobile-friendly width

    If elem contains (or is) a OBJECT element, set its width to a
    mobile-friendly value.  The height attribute, if present, is
    scaled appropriately to preserve the original aspect ratio. This
    is done for both the "object" tag, and also any "embed" tag that
    may be present inside.

    TODO: This will operate on only the first object; if there are
    several object elements within, those beyond the first will be
    ignored.  Best thing is probably to just find and operate on all
    of them.

def resizeiframe(elem, width=280):

    Resize an iframe to have a mobile-friendly width

    If elem contains (or is) an iframe element, set its width to a
    mobile-friendly value.  The height attribute, if present, is
    scaled appropriately to preserve the original aspect ratio. 

    This was originally created for the resizing of iframe-based
    embedded Youtube videos.
