def mk_wsgi_log(environ):

    Create a webserver logging function for a wsgi environment

    This will return a callable that writes to the wsgi.errors file,
    which normally means that messages will be written in the web
    server error log for this (virtual)host.

    Tne callable takes a single argument, a string, which is written
    to the web server error log:

      log = mk_wsgi_log(wsgienviron)
      log('Hello World')
