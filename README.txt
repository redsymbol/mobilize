Mobilize - framework for creating smartphone-optimized versions of full websites

Mobilize is a system for creating smartphone-friendly websites that
are based on an existing full-size website... with little or no
modification on the latter.  The resulting mobile views automatically
and immediately update their content when the source web page changes;
allows arbitrary modification, re-ordering, addition or deletion of
the source website's content; and is compatible with every web
framework, CMS and stack.

Mobilize itself is written in Python 3.4 and runs on Linux, but works
with websites implemented in any language, running on any stack and
operating system.

DOCUMENTATION
